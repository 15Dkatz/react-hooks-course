React Hooks are the biggest update to React that the framework has ever seen. In short, they're a way for function components to "hook" into React functionality. With hooks, you may never write a class-based React compnent again!

Here are the main course highlights:
- Dive into react hooks right away, and waste no time getting writing code with hooks.
- Take a step back and see how React hooks work under the hood.
